Brand Palettes
--------------

I built a large collection of brand palettes from brandpalettes.com. 
My procedure was to use wget to mirror the site to a depth of 1:

    $ wget -r -l 1 https://brandpalettes.com/ 

I had to clean a few directories and files out.  Then I used the tool 
extract_brand_palettes.pl in the tools directory to build a file containing the
meat of a python dictionary. A few manual modifications were then required. Due
to copyright, I'm not including the mirrored files in this repo.
