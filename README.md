Colorways
=========

A Python library for procedural generation of color palettes, color manipulation, and color analysis.


Status Note
===========

My original work on this was lost in a disk crash. In all, I lost several hours of work and the git repo. The current state of the project is from a tarball I created to share with one other developer who I sometimes collaborate with.
